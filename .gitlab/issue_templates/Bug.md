1. I encountered this bug on the **[api, dev, stage, prod]** server.
 

### cURL script

If you have a relevant cURL script to share, you can place it here. Remove 
this section if it isn't relevant. Note that Postman users can get the cURL
script from clicking the `Code` button, then generate a `cURL` request. An
example is shown below.

```
 curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8080/api/v1/registry/access-passes' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-raw '{
 	"status": "APPROVED"
 }'
```

### Error

If you have a specific JSON error response from the server, you can place 
it here, place it here. Otherwise, you can just place error messages here
```
